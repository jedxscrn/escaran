## ü§ñ Machine Learning Projects

This section highlights machine learning projects developed in Jupyter Notebooks, applying statistical modeling and analytical workflows to solve problems with business and scientific impact.

### 1. Forecasting Client Spending Patterns
- **Objective:** Predict next-month spending for 908 clients to optimize promotional campaigns.
- **Approach:** Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), engineered features, and visualized seasonal patterns; identified a ‚àº2√ó holiday spending spike, directly informing marketing strategy.
- **Modeling:** Trained Linear Regression and Random Forest models. Achieved MAPE = **35.2%**, outperforming a naive baseline (44.8%). Implemented KMeans clustering to segment clients for targeted marketing.
- **Impact:** Improved reliability of budget forecasts and enabled data-driven campaign prioritization.

### 2. Data-driven Marketing Campaign Optimization
- **Objective:** Develop a propensity scoring model to rank 1,615 clients by likelihood to engage in marketing campaigns.
- **Pipeline:** Executed EDA, managed missing values, and engineered behavioral features.
- **Modeling:** Built and interpreted Logistic Regression models, achieving up to **80% precision** in identifying high-propensity clients.
- **Outcome:** Extracted actionable insights from feature importances, increasing campaign ROI and marketing efficiency.

### 3. Pok√©mon Type Classifier from Image Data
- **Objective:** Assess whether dominant color features can predict Pok√©mon types from images (809 samples).
- **Techniques:** Used image preprocessing and KMeans clustering for color extraction; trained a Random Forest classifier on color features.
- **Results:** Achieved **27% classification accuracy**, illustrating the limitations of color-only predictions. Thoroughly documented project boundaries and recommended richer feature sets (shape, stats, morphology) for future improvements.
